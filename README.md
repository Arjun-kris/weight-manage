# Weight Manage

**Weight Manage** is a web-based application designed to help users track their weight over time. The app allows users to enter weight data, view progress, and calculate the difference between weight entries between two specific dates. The application is built using **React**, with **Redux** for state management, and utilizes **localStorage** for storing user data.

## Features

- **User Registration & Login**: Users can sign up and log in to track their weight.
- **Weight Tracking**: Users can add and view their weight entries.
- **Date-based Comparison**: Calculate the difference between weight entries between two specific dates (dd/mm/yyyy format).
- **User Profiles**: Store multiple user profiles using localStorage and Redux for user login/logout functionality.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive for mobile and desktop devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, Redux, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- **State Management**: Redux (with localStorage integration)
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub
